# Vertical Layout Components

Understanding the structure of our Vertical Layout is crucial for efficient navigation and customization. This layout comprises several components, each designed for specific functionality and user experience.

## 1. Navigation Menu (left sidebar)

The Navigation Menu, positioned on the left side, is organized for straightforward access and navigation:

- **Navigation Header**: This area showcases your company's brand, featuring the logo and/or name. It also includes icons for toggling the sidebar that allows users to collapse or expand the navigation menu
- **Navigation Section (MenuSection)**: This segment hosts various navigation groups and items, organizing them into coherent sections for better user experience. Learn more about structuring this section [here](/docs/menu-examples/vertical-examples/menu-section)
- **Navigation Group (SubMenu)**: These groups include navigation items or smaller subgroups, forming a hierarchical menu structure. For detailed guidance, see [here](/docs/menu-examples/vertical-examples/submenu)
- **Navigation Item (MenuItem)**: The fundamental unit of the navigation menu, each item represents a link to a specific page of the template. For a deeper understanding, refer [here](/docs/menu-examples/vertical-examples/menu-item).
