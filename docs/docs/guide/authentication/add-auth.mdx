# Add Authentication to Starter-kit

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

:::warning
Only for those who are using the **starter-kit**.
:::

## Overview

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of adding authentication partly or completely to your starter-kit. We'll be using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication.

## With NextAuth

### Prerequisites

- add the following dependency to your project:

  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

  ```bash
  pnpm install next-auth
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn install next-auth
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

  ```bash
  npm install next-auth
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- add the following environment variables from the full-version's `.env` file to your project's `.env` file:

  - `NEXTAUTH_BASEPATH`
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `API_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

- copy the following files from the full-version to your project:

  - `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
  - `src/contexts/nextAuthProvider.tsx`

- add the `NextAuthProvider` import statement and its usage from full-version's `src/components/Providers.tsx` to your project's `src/components/Providers.tsx` file
- add the `src/middleware.ts` file from the full-version to your project

  :::warning Note!
  In the `src/middleware.ts` file, the code for i18n has also been implemented. If you don't need i18n, you can remove its code by following [this guide](/docs/guide/development/translation/how-to-remove-i18n#step-3-modify-middleware-file).

  After adding the `src/middleware.ts` file in your project, you need to remove the `src/app/page.tsx` file from your project as the `src/middleware.ts` file will manage the redirection to your desired home page. Please refer to [this guide](/docs/guide/development/home-page-url) to change your home page's redirection (URL).

### Add Credentials Provider

If you want to use email and password for authentication, you need to add NextAuth's CredentialsProvider. To do so, follow these steps:

- copy the `src/app/api/login` folder from the full-version to your project

- copy the `src/libs/auth.ts` file from the full-version to your project. In this file, the code for the GoogleProvider has also been implemented. If you don't need GoogleProvider, you can remove its code by following the step related to the `src/libs/auth.ts` file from [this guide](/docs/guide/authentication/remove-auth#remove-google-provider-from-the-full-version)

- copy the `src/views/Login.tsx` file from the full-version to your project. In this file, the code for logging in with Google has also been implemented. If you don't need this feature, you can remove its code by following the step related to removing the button for logging in with Google from [this guide](/docs/guide/authentication/remove-auth#remove-google-provider-from-the-full-version)

  :::warning Note!
  The code for i18n has been implemented in the `src/views/Login.tsx` file. If you don't have i18n in your project, you can remove its code from this file
  :::

That's it! You have successfully added NextAuth with CredentialsProvider to your starter-kit.

### Add Google Provider with Prisma Adapter

If you want to use Google for authentication, you need to add a Google provider. To do so, follow these steps:

- add the following dependencies to your project:

  - `@auth/prisma-adapter`
  - `@prisma/client`
  - `prisma`
  - `dotenv-cli`

  Use the following command to add these dependencies:

  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

  ```bash
  pnpm install @auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client prisma dotenv-cli
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn install @auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client prisma dotenv-cli
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

  ```bash
  npm install @auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client prisma dotenv-cli
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- update the following in your `package.json` file:

  ```diff
  "scripts": {
      ...
  +   "migrate": "dotenv -e .env -- npx prisma migrate dev",
  -   "postinstall": "npm run build:icons"
  +   "postinstall": "prisma generate && npm run build:icons"
  },
  "dependencies": {
      ...
  },
  + "prisma": {
  +   "schema": "./src/prisma/schema.prisma"
  + }
  ```

- add the following environment variables from the full-version's `.env` file to your project's `.env` file:

  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `DATABASE_URL`

- copy the `src/libs/auth.ts` file from the full-version to your project. In this file, the code for the CredentialsProvider has also been implemented. If you don't need CredentialsProvider, you can remove its code by following the step related to the `src/libs/auth.ts` file from [this guide](/docs/guide/authentication/remove-auth#remove-credentials-provider-from-the-full-version)

- copy the `src/views/Login.tsx` file from the full-version to your project. In this file, the code for logging in with email and password has also been implemented. If you don't need this feature, you can remove its code by following the steps related to the `src/views/Login.tsx` file from [this guide](/docs/guide/authentication/remove-auth#remove-credentials-provider-from-the-full-version)

  :::warning Note!
  The code for i18n has been implemented in the `src/views/Login.tsx` file. If you don't have i18n in your project, you can remove its code from this file
  :::

- copy the `src/prisma/schema.prisma` file from the full-version to your project

- run the following command to create a new migration:

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="pnpm">

    ```bash
    pnpm migrate
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn migrate
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="npm">

    ```bash
    npm run migrate
    ```

    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

- run the following command to generate Prisma client:

  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

That's it! You have successfully added NextAuth with GoogleProvider and PrismaAdapter to your starter-kit.

### Signing Out

We have implemented the sign-out functionality in the `full-version/src/components/layout/shared/UserDropdown.tsx` file. You may copy the `signOut` import statement and its usage from this file to your project's `src/components/layout/shared/UserDropdown.tsx` file.

### Adding User's Name and Email to User Dropdown

We have shown the user's name and email in the user dropdown in the navbar from the `full-version/src/components/layout/shared/UserDropdown.tsx` file. If you want to show this, you may copy the `useSession` import statement and its usage from this file to your project's `src/components/layout/shared/UserDropdown.tsx` file.
