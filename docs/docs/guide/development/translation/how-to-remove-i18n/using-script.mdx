# Removing i18n from the Template

This guide provides steps to remove i18n (internationalization) from your project.

:::tip
We recommend you to start your project with [**starter-kit**](/docs/guide/overview/starter-kit-vs-full-package) version if you don't need i18n feature. If you are using full-version and you want to remove i18n feature, then this docs is for you.
:::

:::warning
Please be aware that our template supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages like Arabic based on the language settings, automatically applying RTL formatting when an RTL language is selected. For languages like English, it uses Left-to-Right (LTR) formatting. 

If you remove the internationalization (i18n) feature, this automatic RTL support will be disabled, and the template will not switch between RTL and LTR layouts based on the language. 
:::

It can be tricky to remove i18n features by yourself, so we have created a script that does it for you. Just run this script and it will take care of everything.

:::danger Heads Up!
If you modify anything in your project and then run the script, it might break your project. To avoid such breakdown of the template, we recommend you to run the script just after the [installation steps](/docs/guide/overview/installation).
:::

:::danger Warning
Make sure to delete the `.next` folder from the root of your project before and after running the script to avoid errors (if any). If you see errors after running the script, try closing and reopening your editor.
:::

You can find the script in the `src/remove-translation-scripts` folder. We've also added a command in the `package.json` file to run this script easily:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...,
    "removeI18n": "tsx src/remove-translation-scripts/index.ts" // Location of the script
  },
}
```

Pick the command that matches the package manager you have used in your project, and run it to start the script:

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="pnpm">
      <CodeBlock language='bash'>pnpm removeI18n</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="yarn">
      <CodeBlock language='bash'>yarn removeI18n</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="npm">
      <CodeBlock language='bash'>npm run removeI18n</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

That's it! You have successfully removed i18n from your project ðŸ¥³.
