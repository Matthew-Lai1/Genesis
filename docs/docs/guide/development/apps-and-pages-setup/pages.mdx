# How to setup Pages in your project

## Overview

This documentation is a detailed guide on the process of developing pages within our template, with a specific focus on structure, API integration, database management, and styling. We will use the FAQ page as a practical example to illustrate these concepts, making it easier for developers to understand and apply these principles in their own work.

### Server File and API Integration

#### Location and Structure

- Path: The server files for pages are located at `src/app/[lang]/(dashboard)/pages/`.

- Example: For the FAQ page, find the server file at `src/app/[lang]/(dashboard)/pages/faq/page.tsx`.

#### API Call Implementation

- Handling API Calls: In the FAQ page example, the server file includes a function `getFaqData` to fetch data from the API.

  ```tsx
  const getFaqData = async () => {
    const res = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/pages/faq`);
    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch faqData');
    }
    return res.json();
  };

  const FAQPage = async () => {
    const data = await getFaqData();
    return <FAQ data={data} />;
  };

  export default FAQPage
  ```

### Creating APIs

#### API File Location

- Path: APIs specific to pages are created in `src/app/api/pages/`.

#### Routing and Functionality

You may refer to the Next.js routing conventions [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

- Routing: The API routing follows the Next.js app router conventions.

- Example: The API for the FAQ page is defined in `src/app/api/pages/faq/route.ts`.

  ```tsx
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
  import { db } from '@/app/api/fake-db/pages/faq';

  export async function GET() {
    return NextResponse.json(db);
  }
  ```

### Using Fake Databases

#### Storing Fake Data

- Path: Fake database files are stored at `src/app/api/fake-db/pages/`.

- Example: FAQ Page Fake Database is located in `src/app/api/fake-db/pages/faq/index.ts`.

  ```ts
  import type { FaqType } from '@/types/pages/faqTypes';

  export const db: FaqType[] = [
    // ...FAQ data...
  ];
  ```

- For integrating real databases and API calls, refer to [Using Real APIs](/articles/how-to-remove-fake-db-and-use-real-api) for detailed steps.

### Component and Style Management

#### Component Location

- Path: Page-related components are in `src/views/pages/`.

#### Styling Approach

- Recommended Styling: Use Tailwind classes for styling. If custom styles is not possible with Tailwind then only create a `styles.module.css` file in the respective page folder.

- Example: For the FAQ page, styles are organized in `src/views/pages/faq`.

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of how to develop pages in our template. By following the structure and practices outlined here, developers can ensure a smooth integration of their work with the existing template, maintaining high standards of code quality and consistency. The FAQ page serves as a practical example to visualize and understand these concepts effectively.
