# Folder Structure

:::warning Heads Up

Do not make any changes in the `src/@core`, `src/@layout` and `src/@menu` folders unless suggested by our support team. It is the core functionality of the template which is responsible to run the template.

The `src/@core`, `src/@layout` and `src/@menu` folders will receive updates with each new release. Kindly handle these folders with utmost care, as they contain crucial elements that ensure the template runs properly. Unauthorized changes to them could result in conflicts with subsequent updates, potentially disrupting your project.
:::

Understand folder structure of the template and what every folder contains.

## Overview

Before checking folder structure it is better you know some stuff related to folder structure.

- `src/@core`, `src/@layout` and `src/@menu` folders contains core files of template which shall not get modified unless our support team guide you to do it.
- Outside of `src/@core`, `src/@layout` and `src/@menu` folders are files you can move and modify as per your wish. Basically that is your playground where you can modify anything.
- `src/app/api/fake-db` folder just contains dummy data which we get in response of API call. This enables us to take step forward in providing API ready template.
- `src/components` folder outside of `src/@layout` are your layouts which you can modify however you like. Template will always render these layouts.

## @core folder

`src/@core` folder is the core of our template which contains core components, contexts, hooks, styles, etc where you should not make any change but override them with the help of our docs in case of any changes required in core files.

`src/@core` folder isn't meant to get modified. When you will update our template replacing this `src/@core` folder will hopefully update the template with minimum changes.

:::warning Heads Up
If you want to customize components, utilize the `src/components` folder, which is specifically intended for such modifications and provides a safer avenue for personalization without impacting the core structure of the template.
:::

It's a good idea to have a look at it and know what it contains to use stuff we already invented so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

### Understanding Core folder

## @layout folder

`src/@layout` folder contains styles, svg, utils, layout components like Blank Layout, Vertical Layout, Horizontal Layout, Layout Wrapper, etc. where you should not make any changes but override them with the help of our docs in case of any changes required in layout files.

`src/@layout` folder isn't meant to get modified. When you will update our template replacing this `src/@layout` folder will hopefully update the template with minimum changes.

:::warning Heads Up
If you want to customize/add any layout, create the `src/layouts` folder. You may copy any layout from the `src/@layouts` folder and paste in the newly created folder and customize it according to your needs.
