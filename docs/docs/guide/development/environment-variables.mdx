## What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are a set of key-value pairs used in software development to manage and configure elements of your application outside of your code. They are particularly useful for:

- **Security:** Keeping sensitive data like passwords and API keys out of your source code.
- **Flexibility:** Allowing different settings for development, testing, and production environments without changing the code.
- **Convenience:** Enabling easy changes to configuration without the need for code modifications.

In your project, these variables play a vital role in configuring the application's behavior based on the environment it's running in (like local development, staging, or production).

<TemplateName /> comes with support for environment variables, which allows you to use `.env` to load the environment variables.

:::tip
We recommend you to read the [official guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) given by Next.js for using environment variables.

## Environment variables used in the template

To configure your environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Fill in the required values in the `.env` file.
3. Make sure to mention your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file. You may generate your secret by referring to [this](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret) link.
4. If you are using google authentication, make sure to mention your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
5. If you want to include the `.env` file in your repository, remove the `.env` statement from the `.gitignore` file.

By following these steps, you can set up and manage your environment variables effectively.

We have use the `fake-db` and fake-db API calls are not supported to access the environment variables. Hence, we have used `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix with our environment variables. You can find the environment variables' file `.env` in the root of the project. The environment variables that we have used in the `.env` file are as follows:

```bash
BASEPATH=
API_URL=http://localhost:3000${BASEPATH}/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000${BASEPATH}
```

### Authentication

Authentication variables in the .env file are used to configure authentication settings for your application. These variables are specific to the authentication library you are using, such as NextAuth.js.

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - This variable specifies the URL of your application. It is used by NextAuth.js to generate callback URLs and handle authentication redirects.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - This variable is used to encrypt cookies and tokens. It is used by NextAuth.js to encrypt and decrypt cookies and tokens.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - This variable is used to configure the Google OAuth 2.0 client ID. It is used by NextAuth.js to authenticate users using Google.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - This variable is used to configure the Google OAuth 2.0 client secret. It is used by NextAuth.js to authenticate users using Google.

We have used the [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) library for authentication. You may refer to the environment variables used in the NextAuth.js library [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#environment-variables).

```bash
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_BASEPATH=${BASEPATH}/api/auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000${BASEPATH}/api/auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

### Database

Database variables in the .env file are used to configure database settings for your application. These variables are specific to the database you are using, such as MongoDB.

- `DATABASE_URL` - This variable is used to configure the database connection string or file path. It is used by the database client to connect to the database.

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
```

Make sure to replace the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your actual values and it's advisable to remove the `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix if you are using the Next.js data fetching method or API routes.

## Private Variables

Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  analytics.disable()
}
```
