# Demo Configs

Dive into our `demo-configs` folder (special folder inside `typescript-version` / `javascript-version` folder), your go-to resource for fetching the exact theme configurations showcased in our demos. This treasure trove allows you to replicate the look and feel of our demos with ease.

Simply select and copy the configuration file's content corresponding to the demo you wish to emulate from the `demo-configs` folder. Then, paste this file's content into your project's `src/configs/themeConfig.ts` to transform your application's appearance.

**Important Reminder:** Remember, some configurations rely on `sessionStorage` and `cookies` for storage. To see the changes reflect accurately, you might need to clear your browser's application data. Check out [this guide](/docs/faqs/how-to-clear-browser-cache) for instructions on clearing application data in your browser.
