# AppReactDropzone

This guide details how to use `react-dropzone`, a customizable drag-and-drop file upload library, with Material-UI styling in a Next.js application. For more information on React Dropzone, see the [official documentation](https://react-dropzone.js.org/).

## Overview

React Dropzone offers a simple and accessible drag-and-drop file upload interface. To ensure it fits seamlessly within Material-UI themed applications, we have wrapped it in a custom styled component.

## Styling React Dropzone

To provide a consistent look and feel with Material-UI, we style the dropzone area using Material-UI's styling capabilities. The AppReactDropzone component is a styled Material-UI Box that forms the dropzone area, adapting it to the application's design theme.

### Styled Component: AppReactDropzone

`AppReactDropzone` is a Material-UI `Box` component that styles the dropzone area, ensuring it integrates well with the Material-UI theme. This component can be used to wrap individual upload components or entire pages containing multiple upload components.

Example: Defining AppReactDropzone

```tsx
// MUI and other necessary imports
import Box from '@mui/material/Box';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';

// Styled Components
const AppReactDropzone = styled(Box)<BoxProps>(({ theme }) => ({
  // Custom styles for the React Dropzone...
}));

export default AppReactDropzone;
```

This snippet sets up `AppReactDropzone` to offer a customized drag-and-drop file upload experience in line with Material-UI design.

## Implementing the Styled React Dropzone

Using `AppReactDropzone`, you can easily incorporate a styled file upload area into your application.

Example: File Uploader with Multiple Files

```tsx
import AppReactDropzone from '@/libs/styles/AppReactDropzone';

const FileUploaderMultiple = () => {
  // Additional logic for handling file uploads

  return (
    <AppReactDropzone>
      {/* Dropzone content and logic */}
    </AppReactDropzone>
  );
};

export default FileUploaderMultiple;
```

In this example, FileUploaderMultiple is a functional component that uses `AppReactDropzone` to create a file upload area. It demonstrates how to integrate the dropzone into your application.
