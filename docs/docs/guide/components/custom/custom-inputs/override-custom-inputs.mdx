# Override custom input style

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

To override or customized the styles, follow these steps:

Let us say you want to customize the `CustomInputHorizontal` component.(you can customize other custom input components as well by following the same steps).

You can override the styles in both the `src/components/theme/userTheme.ts` or `src/components/theme/mergedTheme.ts` file.

You may refer to the following code snippet:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="MergedTheme.ts">

```tsx title='src/components/theme/MergedTheme.ts'
const MergedTheme = () => {
  const userTheme = {
    components: {
      MuiCustomInputHorizontal: {
        styleOverrides: {
          title : {
            color: '#fff',
            fontSize: '1.25rem',
          }
        }
      }
    }
  } as Theme

return deepmerge(coreTheme(), userTheme)
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="userTheme.ts">

```tsx title='src/components/theme/userTheme.ts'
const userTheme = (): Theme => {
  return {
    components: {
      MuiCustomInputHorizontal: {
        styleOverrides: {
          title : {
            color: '#fff',
            fontSize: '1.25rem',
          }
        }
      }
    }
  } as Theme
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You have to add `mergedTheme` or `userTheme` in `index.tsx` file. You may refer to [this](/docs/guide/development/theming/overview#common-customization-steps) on how to implement it.

That's it ! You have successfully customized the styles of `CustomInputHorizontal` component.ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
