Here are some **benefits** of having access to the GitHub repository of our template:

1. **Issue Tracking:** Users can submit issues or feature requests directly to the repository. This allows the development team to track and resolve these issues in an organized manner.

2. **Development Status:** Users can track the development status of the project. They can see what features are being worked on and when they are expected to be completed.

3. **Searchability:** Users can easily search through previously reported issues. This can help them find solutions to problems they are facing more quickly.

4. **Collaboration:** Users can submit pull requests to fix bugs or add new features. This allows them to directly contribute to the project.

5. **Version Control:** Users can download the latest stable version of the project, as well as previous versions. This can be useful if a new version introduces a bug that affects their use of the project.

6. **Community:** Being part of a GitHub repository allows users to be part of a community. They can interact with other users and the development team, ask questions, and share ideas.
