# Getting Started

import { TemplateName } from '@site/src/components/TemplateName'

<TemplateName /> is tailored for both TypeScript and JavaScript enthusiasts, this template is your golden ticket to accelerating project development without compromising on customization.

We provide detailed documentation exclusively for our layouts, menu, custom components and any modifications applied to Material-UI (MUI) components. To learn more about the standard MUI components, please refer to the [official Material-UI documentation](https://mui.com/).

There are two main scenarios while starting with our template:

1. **Starting a New Project**: If you're initiating a new project, our template provides a robust starting point.
2. **Integrating into an Existing Project**: Since this is a template and a starter project, it's built as the starting point of your project. It cannot be simply installed and used with an existing project like a third party library.

    Although using our template with any existing project is still possible, it would require extra work to connect everything together. We strongly recommend you to either start your project with <TemplateName />, or move your project on top of it to have the best experience.

## Getting Started Simplified

Jumpstart your project with our Starter Kitâ€”a lean, mean setup meant to speed up your project's kickoff. Inside the template zip, you'll find both **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** versions, each with a **full-version** and **starter-kit** folder to choose from. Here's how to proceed:

- **Choose Your Flavor:** Pick between **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** versions based on your preference.
- **Starter Kit:** Ideal for those who value simplicity and efficiency. It contains only the essentials, making it perfect for small projects or as a starting point.

:::tip
**Begin with the Starter Kit:** Start simple with the Starter Kit to enjoy a hassle-free initiation into your project. It's designed to give you a smooth start, with the option to scale up by integrating components from the full version as your project grows.
:::

:::warning
**File Path Awareness:** For JavaScript users, remember to tweak the file paths as our documentation leans towards TypeScript references. Here's a quick example to guide you:

TypeScript Path: `src/components/Providers.tsx`

JavaScript Path: `src/components/Providers.jsx`
:::

Start with the essentials and gradually build your way up. This approach not only keeps the initial phase manageable but also leaves room for adding complexity as your project evolves.
