# v3.0.0 to v3.1.0

To ensure a smooth migration from version 3.0.0 to 3.1.0, please follow these steps carefully. We recommend starting by comparing your `package.json` file with the templateâ€™s `package.json` file and updating all dependencies accordingly.

## Scroll to Top

We have added a `scroll-to-top` feature on the front pages. To add this button in your project, copy the `src/app/front-pages/layout.tsx` file from the template and paste it into your project.

## Mode Flicker Issue

We have fixed the mode flicker issue when `settings.mode` & system both have dark mode and open 2 two tabs side by side, mode was flickering when we refresh any of the 2 pages. You need to make the following changes:

- Copy the `src/components/theme/index.tsx` file and `src/components/theme/ModeChanger.tsx` file from the template and paste them into your project.

## Logo

We have updated logo file. You need to copy the `src/components/layout/shared/Logo.tsx` file from the template and paste it into your project.

## Other Changes

There might be some other changes that you need to make in your project. Please follow [this](/docs/faqs/how-to-update-this-template) guide for the same.
