# Overview

This documentation provides an in-depth guide to using custom React Hooks used in our template. If you are new to React Hooks, we recommend you to read the [official React Hooks documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) first.

In our template, we have included the [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) library.

You can use these custom hooks anywhere in your project. We'll explain how each custom hook works in detail and provide examples to help you understand their functionalities and how to use these hooks in your project.
