# How to integrate this template into my existing project?

Since this is a template and a starter project, it's built as the starting point of your project. It cannot be simply integrated into your existing project like a third party library.

Although using our template with any existing project is still possible, it would require extra efforts to connect everything together. We strongly recommend you to either start your project with our Template, or move your existing project on top of it to have the best experience.
