# How to update this template?

We are making template update as easy as possible from our side. We create our folder structure which makes updating process easier than ever. üòç

:::tip
Mostly replacing the `src/@core`, `src/@layouts` and `src/@menu` folders in your project is enough. Still, verifying if something outside of these folders is changed or not is always helpful and keeps you error free. üòá

Let's check how you can view each and every change in our template's latest release with ease.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- VS Code Extension: [Compare Folders](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moshfeu.compare-folders)
- Package you started your project with (older package of the template you are using)
- Latest package of the template

## Steps

1. Unzip both the packages
2. Replace the `src/@core`, `src/@layouts` and `src/@menu` folders in your project with the latest package's `src/@core`, `src/@layouts` and `src/@menu` folders
3. Use the [Compare Folders](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moshfeu.compare-folders) extension and compare both packages for changes to adopt them in your project
