# How to Implement ACL?

We have not implemented ACL in our template. This decision was made after careful consideration and feedback analysis. We realized that our customers have varied preferences and requirements for ACL implementation. To cater to this diversity and to maintain the flexibility of our template, we've opted not to include ACL in our template.

However, we understand the importance of ACL in many of our clients' projects. We have a few recommendations for implementing ACL in your project:

- [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay-atEUGIc4)
- [Medium article](https://medium.com/@chsherryy/implementing-role-based-access-control-in-next-js-next-auth-with-prisma-and-mongodb-324f1929cf93)

We believe this approach will provide a more tailored experience, allowing users to implement the version of ACL that best fits their specific needs, without being constrained by a one-size-fits-all solution embedded in the template.
