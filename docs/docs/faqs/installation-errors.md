# Installation errors

**Causes of `pnpm install`, `yarn install` or `npm install` issues can be due to various things which include:**

- Missing or inappropriate dependencies like node or some other environmental issues.
- Dependency resolved by package manager (pnpm/yarn/npm) conflicts with other installed dependency.
- The dependency of the package we use have an internal issue or that dependency has some issue with your environment.
- Package or dependency of the package requires some additional step or configuration to work in your environment.
- Downloaded package is broken or is tampered with.

**To resolve such installation issues:**

- Try using `pnpm` if possible (recommended).
- Please try downloading the fresh package/zip and performing the installation again.
- Please make sure you are using the LTS version of node which is recommended and not one with the latest features.
- Try running the `pnpm cache clean`, `yarn cache clean` or `npm cache clean` command.

**After following the steps explained above, if you are still getting any errors, please [raise support](/docs/guide/overview/getting-support) at our support portal with the below details:**
