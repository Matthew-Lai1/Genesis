# How to Configure Local Template to look like one of the 6 demos you see online?

When you run the template for the first time your local template will always look like 1st demo you saw from the store.

There are 6 demos in total and you may want your local template to look like any of the demo you saw online.

To achieve this, we provide a `demo-configs` folder in the package and you  can easily override configs with the help of those demo config files,

Please refer to [demo configs documentation](/docs/guide/development/demo-config) to change the demo config and make it look like you wanted.
