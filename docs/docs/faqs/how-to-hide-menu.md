# How to change screen size to hide the menu?

The main question is what will happen to the navigation menu in screen size smaller than desktop and laptop. We hide the navigation menu inside a drawer which would be accessible from the Hamburger menu icon in the navbar. Currently, we have set the breakpoint to 1200px. So, the navigation menu will be hidden in screen size smaller than 1200px.

A user has the freedom to change the breakpoint from which the user wants to hide the navigation menu.

Please refer to [this](/docs/menu-examples/vertical-examples/vertical-nav/breakpoint) docs to change the breakpoint in the Vertical layout.

Please refer to [this](/docs/menu-examples/horizontal-examples/horizontal-nav/breakpoint) docs to change the breakpoint in the Horizontal layout.
