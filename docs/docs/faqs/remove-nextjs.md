# Can I remove Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a react framework which gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server-side rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, your custom webpack, etc. React also recommends to start a new project with Next.js. Please refer to the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) for the same.

Please refer following articles which should convince you to start your next project on Next.js rather than on plain React. It does not have a huge learning curve and it will benefit you in many ways:

- [Create React App (CRA) vs Next.js](https://npmtrends.com/create-react-app-vs-next)
- [Next.js Benefits](https://medium.com/eincode/what-are-the-benefits-of-the-next-js-framework-7c5b083c8d23)

You may refer to the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

This template is created with Next.js as the base and thus, Next.js cannot be removed from the template.
