# Dynamically Rendering React Icons in Menu Based on API Data

In this article, we will guide you through the process of using dynamic React Icons in the Menu. This feature is especially useful when you need to render icons dynamically based on data received from an API. 

You will have to create a helper component, `DynamicIcon`, to simplify this process. This component leverages Next.js's dynamic import feature to load icons on demand, thereby optimizing your application's performance.

### Getting started

Before we dive into the implementation details, ensure that your project is set up and running. You should also have the `react-icons` package installed in your template. If you haven't already installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>pnpm install react-icons</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>yarn install react-icons</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>npm install react-icons</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Understanding the `DynamicIcon` component

The `DynamicIcon` component is designed for integrating dynamic icon rendering. It leverages Next.js's dynamic import feature from `next/dynamic` to load icons on demand. This helps to optimize your application's performance by only loading the icons that are required. This component is particularly useful for applications that need to render icons dynamically based on data received from an API.

#### Key Featured of the `DynamicIcon` component:
- **Dynamic Imports with Next.js**: Utilizes Next.js's `dynamic` function to import dynamically based on the component's props.
- `iconFamily` **prop**: Determines the library  from which to import the icon (e.g., `fa` for Font Awesome, `fi` for feather icons). This prop makes the component versatile allowing it to support multiple icon libraries with ease.
- `icon` **prop**: Specifies the exact icon to be dynamically imported from the chosen library.
- **Fallback Icons**: Provides a default fallback icon for each library to handle cases where the specified icon cannot be found. This feature ensures that your UI remains consistent and error-free, even when an icon is missing or incorrectly named.
- **Expandability**: The `DynamicIcon` component is designed to be easily expandable. You can include as many icon libraries as you need by importing them and adding them to the Icons object with appropriate fallbacks.

#### How to make this work in the template

To use the `DynamicIcon` component, you need to follow these steps:

1. Copy the `DynamicIcon` component code from the snippet below and paste it into a new file in your project, such as `DynamicIcon.tsx`/`DynamicIcon.js` respectively for TypeScript or JavaScript version in the `src/components` directory.

    <TsToJsCodeSnippet>{`
        // Next Imports
        import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

        import { FaRegCircle } from 'react-icons/fa'
        import { FiCircle } from 'react-icons/fi'

        // React imports
        import type { IconBaseProps } from 'react-icons'

        type DynamicIconProps = {
          iconFamily: string
          icon: string
        }

        type IconsMapping = {
          [key: string]: React.ComponentType<IconBaseProps>
        }

        const DynamicIcon = ({ iconFamily, icon }: DynamicIconProps) => {
          const Icons: IconsMapping = {
            fa: dynamic(
              () =>
                import('react-icons/fa').then(mod => mod[icon]).then(e => (e === undefined ? FaRegCircle : e)) as Promise<
                  React.ComponentType<IconBaseProps>
                >
            ),
            fi: dynamic(
              () =>
                import('react-icons/fi').then(mod => mod[icon]).then(e => (e === undefined ? FiCircle : e)) as Promise<
                  React.ComponentType<IconBaseProps>
                >
            )
          }

          const Icon = iconFamily && icon ? Icons[iconFamily] : null

          return <>{Icon && <Icon />}</>
        }

        export default DynamicIcon
        `}
    </TsToJsCodeSnippet>

2. Now you need to import the `DynamicIcon` component into `src/components/GenerateMenu.tsx` and use it like the following:

    ```diff
    - const icon = <i className={menuItem.icon} />
    + const icon = menuItem.icon && menuItem.iconFamily && (
    +   <DynamicIcon iconFamily={menuItem.iconFamily} icon={menuItem.icon} />
    + )

    - const { children, ...rest } = subMenuItem
    + // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
    + const { children, iconFamily, ...rest } = subMenuItem

    - <VerticalSubMenu key={index} {...rest} icon={icon}>
    + <VerticalSubMenu key={index} {...rest} icon={icon || undefined}>
    ```
    
    Add this before returning the `VerticalMenuItem` component:

    ```tsx
    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
    const { iconFamily, ...rest } = menuItem
    ```

    ```diff
    - <VerticalMenuItem key={index} {...menuItem} href={href} icon={icon}>
    + <VerticalMenuItem key={index} {...rest} href={href} icon={icon || undefined}>
    ```

  3. Now update `src/types/menuTypes.ts` file, add iconFamily for `VerticalMenuItemDataType` and `VerticalSubMenuDataType` for TypeScript version only.
      ```tsx
      export type VerticalMenuItemDataType = Omit<VerticalMenuItemProps, ...> & {
        ....
        iconFamily?: string
      }

      export type VerticalSubMenuDataType = Omit<VerticalSubMenuProps, ...> & {
        ...
        iconFamily?: string
      }
      ```

  4. That is it! You have successfully integrated the `DynamicIcon` component into your template. You can now dynamically render icons based on data received from an API.

  :::tip
  You can do the same for Horizontal Menu, to use dynamic icons.

  :::tip
  If you want to use a different library than react-icons, you can take the `DynamicIcon` component as a reference or ispiration and create your own component. All you need to figure out is how to dynamically import the icons from the library you are using like prop-types, etc.
