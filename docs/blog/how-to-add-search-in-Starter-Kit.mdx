# How to add Search in Starter Kit

The search functionality is available only in the `full-version`. If you have started your project using the `starter-kit` as per our suggestion, please follow the steps below to implement the search functionality in your project.

#### Step 1: Install `cmdk` Package

Begin by installing the `cmdk` package, which is required for the search functionality.

Run the appropriate command in your project's root directory based on your package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>pnpm install cmdk</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>yarn add cmdk</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>npm install cmdk</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Step 2: Copy Search Components

Copy the `full-version/src/components/layout/shared/search` folder from the `full-version` and paste it into your project's `src/components/layout/shared` folder.

#### Step 3: Create `searchData.ts` File

Create a `searchData.ts` file in your project's `src/data` folder. This file will contain the data to be used for the search functionality.

#### Step 4: Update Navbar

Import the `<NavSearch />` component into the `src/components/layout/vertical/NavbarContent.tsx` file. Add it after the `<NavToggle />` component.

That's it. You have successfully implemented the search functionality in your project. ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰
