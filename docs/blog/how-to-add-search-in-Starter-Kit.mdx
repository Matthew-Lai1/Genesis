# How to add Search in Starter Kit

Search has been implemented in the full-version only. If you have started your project using the starter kit as per our suggestion, please follow the below steps in order to implement search functionality in your project.

Begin by installing `kbar` package which is related to search functionality

Run the appropriate command in your project's root directory based on your package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>pnpm install kbar</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>yarn install kbar</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">
    <CodeBlock language='bash'>npm install kbar</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

1. Copy `full-version/src/components/layout/shared/search` folder from the full-version and paste it in your project's `src/components/layout/shared` folder.

2. You have to create a `searchData.ts/js` file in your project's `src/data/` folder. This file will contain the data that will be used for search.

3. Import the `<NavSearch />` component in `src/components/layout/vertical/NavbarContent.tsx` file and add after the `<NavToggle />` component.

That's it. You have successfully implemented search functionality in your project.ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
